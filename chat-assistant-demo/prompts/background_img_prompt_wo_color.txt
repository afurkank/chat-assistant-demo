USER_PROMPT="""
You are tasked with finding a prompt for background image generation \
based on a form's title. This image will be used as the \
background of the form.

Here are some examples:

Form title: 'Summer Camp & Hiking Application Form'
Prompt: 'A serene summer camp, with tall trees under the blue sky. \
There is a trail leading to a distant mountain peak.'

Form title: 'Doctor Appointment Request Form'
Prompt: 'A clean and modern medical office, with soft natural light \
streaming through large windows. There are comfortable chairs and \
a desk with medical tools neatly arranged.'

Form title: 'Rescue Dog Adoption Application Form'
Prompt: 'A warm and welcoming animal shelter, with playful dogs \
of various breeds in a spacious, grassy yard. There are cozy \
kennels and cheerful volunteers interacting with the dogs.'

Do not ask for people or animals to be in the image you write your prompt for as \
they are hard to get right. 
It is important that you return only the prompt and nothing else. Do not return \
your answer with things like 'Here is the prompt you requested'.

Here is the title of the form: {heading}.
Now write your prompt:
